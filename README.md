## 🔐 Authentication Notes

Before running the app you need to enable the authentication methods you intend to use (email/password and/or Google) in the Firebase console for the project defined in `src/firebase/firebaseconfig.js`.

A simple login/register page is available at `/login`. The navigation bar shows a "Sign In" link when the user is not authenticated and switches to the user's email & a logout button after signing in. All data pages display a message asking the visitor to sign in.

> **Routing note for GitHub Pages:** the app now uses `HashRouter` (URL fragments like `/#/settings`) so that client-side navigation works after refreshing or when users share links. No server configuration is required; just deploy the `dist` folder as usual.

## 📦 Deployment

This project is deployed using **GitHub Pages** via the production build folder (`dist`).

### GitHub Pages
1. Add a `homepage` field to `package.json` (e.g. `"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/Student-Dashboard"`).
2. Install the gh-pages package if you don't already: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`.
3. Add deployment scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```
4. Run `npm run deploy`.

### Firebase Hosting (alternate)
1. Install CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` and run `firebase login`.
2. Initialize hosting inside the repo and select `dist` as the public directory.
3. When prompted, configure as a single‑page app (rewrite all urls to `/index.html`).
4. Build the project (`npm run build`) and deploy with `firebase deploy`.

> Note: ensure the Firebase project in `src/firebase/firebaseconfig.js` matches the one you deploy to.
